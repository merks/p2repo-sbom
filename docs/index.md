# CBI p2 SBOM Generator

The CBI p2 SBOM Generator supports generating a high-quality SBOM from a p2 repository or an Eclipse Installation.
The generator provides the following:
- A headless product to support a command line interface.
- IDE integration to drive the generation process from within an IDE.

The project also supports a [web-based render](https://download.eclipse.org/cbi/sbom/) to provide a user-friendly overview of an SBOM's overwhelmingly-large volume of textual content.

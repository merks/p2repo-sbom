# Maven/Jenkins Integration

Because the CBI p2 SBOM Generator can be applied directly to the artifacts already produced by existing continuous integration processes,
it's easy to integrate SBOM generation into a project's build processes.


## Proof of Concept

The following jobs are used to test the generator with various combinations of command line options
and provide a basis for producing your own jobs:

## Projects Using the CBI p2 SBOM Generator

The SBOM generator is used by the following projects to produce SBOM for publishing to [https://sbom.eclipse.org](https://sbom.eclipse.org),
providing samples that serve as basis for other projects to generated SBOMs and to publish then to dependency-track.

### Orbit

Orbit uses a self-contained [Jenkins pipeline](https://github.com/eclipse-orbit/orbit-simrel/blob/main/orbit-aggregation/OrbitAggregationSBOM.jenkinsfile)
to generate SBOMs published to [sbom.eclipse.org](https://sbom.eclipse.org/projects/a598db3e-3857-4ef2-a8ad-c75db18cdd35/collectionprojects).

### SimRel

SimRel uses a self-contained [Jenkins pipeline](https://github.com/eclipse-simrel/simrel.build/blob/main/Jenkinsfile-sbom/)
to generate SBOMs published to [sbom.eclipse.org](https://sbom.eclipse.org/projects/e1ac111b-8567-403c-8df7-950588c102e9/collectionprojects).
